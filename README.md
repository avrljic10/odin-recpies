# odin-recpies
First practice from odin, we will try to make a somewhat nice looking page, just with HTML
This repository will consist a clean HTML only.
We will try to make a web page of recipes using only HTML.
We should be able to show oru so far gained knowledge of HTML, but since I am still in a learning position, here should be some question asking and google-ing to make this web page as nice as possible, and to use as much as possible different sources and code variations to learn about HTML, before getting into CSS and JavaScript.
