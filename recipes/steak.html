    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Butcher (or hanger) steak is great pan cooked, broiled, or grilled. It 
        takes to marinades wonderfully, and really can be substituted for 
        any cut of steak. Just be sure to take the time to trim it well.
    </p>
    
    <p style="color: red; background-color: yellow;">I have not had any success cooking steaks because they are always tough. 
        I found this recipe and went to our local butcher and told him what I 
        needed. I cooked this steak AND the sauce as shown in the video and 
        recipe. This was such a complete success and the meat was unbelievably 
        tender and tasteful. I'm giddy with excitement as I will never use 
        another cut of steak again except the butcher steak. IT was truly like 
        eating an expensive cut but for 1.5 pounds, it cost me $12 and the 
        pieces were so big, we are having the two leftover steaks, tomorrow. 
        This chef knows his food and I'm so excited to have found him online!
    </p>
    <p>So simple and so good! I had never heard of this cut when I found it 
        in a German grocery store. Will definitely be on the lookout for 
        it in the future.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (2 pound) butcher's steak (hanger steak)</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon clarified butter</li>
        <li>â…” cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cold butter, cut into cubes</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h4>Step 1:</h4>
    <p>Remove all silver skin and extra fat from the steak. Carefully cut out 
        the connective tissue that connects the 2 halves of the steak, separating 
        the whole into 2 long pieces. Cut lobe of meat from one half (it's a 
        piece that is slightly separated from the larger half). Then cut each 
        of the 2 larger halves into 2 steaks each. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 2:</h4>
    <p>Heat skillet over high heat. Add clarified butter when pan is hot, 
        then place the steaks in the pan. Reduce heat to medium. Cook until 
        browned on all sides, firm, and reddish-pink on the inside. An 
        instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 125 
        degrees F (52 degrees C), a total of about 12 minutes. (This cut of 
        meat has a sort of triangular shape, so about 4 minutes per side.) 
        Transfer to a warm plate and tent with foil to let steaks rest and 
        allow temperature to rise to 130 degrees F.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 3:</h4>
    <p>Pour stock into skillet set over medium heat. Stir with a wooden 
        spoon scraping up the browned bits from the bottom. When brownings 
        dissolve and liquid begins to reduce after 2 or 3 minutes, reduce heat 
        to low. Add accumulated juices from the meat, balsamic vinegar, and 
        butter chunks. Cook and stir until butter melts. If liquid has reduced 
        too much, add a splash of broth. Taste to check if sauce needs a bit of salt.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 4:</h4>
    <p>To serve, slice steaks and spoon pan sauce over them.</p>
